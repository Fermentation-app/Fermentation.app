// StepsContainer

// The main point of all of this : onChangeText={(text) => onChange(name)(text)}
// This allows us to dynamically add new custom fields and track the state separatly using Formik magic without complex store manipulation.

// This component ONLY WORKS within a <Formik> component and as a child of a <Field> component.

// This is the Accordion Component core to our main feature : the recipe from the step approach, each step being a collapsible element in which
// we can find nested fields describing every step our ferment takes or what we are suppose to do. Props used here :
// 'activeSections' tracks the section that is currently open. The useState hook keeps track of that.
// 'section' is an array of the steps that are dynamically added by the user.
// 'renderHeader' & 'renderContent' are component with a <View> in it, which are composed in our case with more forms.
// 'touchableComponent' is the component used to reference the 'on header press' sequence. Here we chose to use TouchableOpacity but
// TouchableWithoutFeedback was also possible.
// 'duration' is the time taken to open the section.
// 'onChange' opens the good section asked by the user.
// For additionnal props see the documentation, referenced in the App Wiki.
